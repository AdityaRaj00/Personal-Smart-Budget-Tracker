Crypto Arbitrage Bot Developer with CCXT, AAVE Flash Loans, and Capital Controls
Project Overview
We are seeking an experienced blockchain developer or quant developer to build a fully automated crypto arbitrage trading bot. The bot should detect and execute arbitrage opportunities across multiple Indian and global exchanges, implement safety and capital controls, and optionally use AAVE Flash Loans to optimize liquidity.
Core Objectives
1. Detect arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges (e.g., all exchanges that are listed on coingapp
2. Automatically execute trades where the arbitrage profit margin exceeds combined trading + gas fees
3. Ensure trade volume is capped to:
- 10% of total portfolio balance
- 10% of the lesser volume between the two exchanges
4. Integrate AAVE Flash Loans (optional per opportunity) with up to 10% of total balance allocated to gas fees
5. Use CCXT or equivalent libraries for multi-exchange trading
6. Allow integration with external scanners (e.g., Coingapp) for initial opportunity sourcing
7. Include compounding return logic and daily performance tracking
8. Provide logging, dashboards, and error alerts
Example Trade Execution Logic
Crypto A is priced at $1.00 on Binance and $1.05 on CoinDCX
Binance volume = $100, CoinDCX volume = $50
Total fees = 2.5%, Net profit = 2.5%
Bot executes a trade worth $5 (10% of lesser volume, within 10% of portfolio cap)
Optional: Uses AAVE Flash Loan if gas fees ≤ 10% of portfolio
Tech Stack Preferred
- Python (Required)
- CCXT (Required)
- Web3.py or ethers.js (for AAVE integration)
- Pandas/Numpy for calculations
- FastAPI / Flask (Optional for interface)
- MongoDB or SQLite for logs and trade history
- Docker (Optional for deployment)
Deliverables
- Fully working arbitrage scanner & executor
- Config file for setting parameters (threshold %, gas fee %, trade caps)
- AAVE Flash Loan integration (configurable switch)
- Trade simulator for compounding returns
- Logs & alerts (success, failure, skipped trades)
- Brief documentation for setup and usage
Ideal Candidate Will Have
- Strong experience in crypto trading bots
- Past work with arbitrage, flash loans, and exchange APIs
- Experience with DeFi protocols like AAVE
- Familiarity with Indian exchange APIs
- Security best practices for handling keys and capital
How to Apply
Please include:
- Links to relevant previous bot projects
- Your approach for implementing the trade logic & safety checks
- Any challenges you foresee with flash loans"

I was looking for somebody to somehow create a cover for an upcoming book. I have acquired a license to write a novel around the horror franchise, Scream. The book is a direct sequel to an unfinished TV series from a few years back. However, the process of providing cover art is solely down to me. Rather than tackle this myself, I'd rather have a professional create the cover.

The cover would need to feature the mask/killer from the TV Show. It isn't Ghostface, but an entirely different mask. I have provided photographs of the mask below.

Please provide examples of past works."
